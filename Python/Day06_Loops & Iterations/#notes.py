print()
                #now while loops

                #NOW DISCLAMER IF YOU WERE TO RUN A WHILE TRUE CODE,
                #IT WILL RUN FOREVER AND U CAN STOP IT BY PRESSING CTRL + C

#ok thats just all for the vid ig, so i only learned like 40% more of loops
#with the while loops and while true thing, noww onto the exercise
#also the vscode assistant is back so most of the time itll do most of the debugging
#will save alot of time but makes me kind of feel lazy, but ill still try to learn

#Exercise
#ill put the exercise at the end because if i put it in the start the assistant
#will just do it for me and i wont learn anything, so ill just put it at the end
